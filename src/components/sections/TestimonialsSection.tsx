To address the city's decades-long housing crisis and make New York City the best place to raise a family, we must take bold, transformational action to build more homes in transit-rich areas near New Yorkers' jobs and services.",

Our administration wants to build enough housing for the next generation of San Franciscans, so that kids who grow up here have the same opportunity to raise their own children here. For too long, San Francisco has made it easier to block new homes than to build them. And while our needs have changed since the 1970s, much of our zoning hasn't.",
